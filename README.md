This repository is a collection of experiments in various programming languages.  Experiments are organized by branches and a running list of experiments is maintained below, each with its own version of this README describing the experiment.  

Feel free to use, adapt, and distribute, but changes to the source code must be open source (and I would appreciate an email about what you did with it!).
